After dragons have desperately struck humankind with their enending rage, heroes would rise equipped with the most dangerous of weaponry. This poor soul took it upon themselves to seal this power forever, for no one to ever use it again. Creating their ow domain, Bramimonde lost not only their friends, but themselves. This creature is inspired by Bramimond from Fire Emblem 7. I always loved the idea of loss and what comes with utmost dedication and it was the first real "experiment" I conducted with pet profiles!
