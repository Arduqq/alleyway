"Go.", you think to yourself as you make your way through this dark thicket. Your feet hurt, pebbles made their way into your shoes. It's not far, you keep mumbling. The camp is near and you will rest eventually. There is barely a cloud in the sky to cover the bright light of the moon. The path unfolds by itself - you are feeling full of energy. It has been days, weeks or months since you have entered the Sommervald out of pure curiosity, yet here you are, eagerly wandering around aimlessly.
