The weapon crafting enterprise headed by Ha’danas Rosestrider was known throughout Silvermoon; the Rosestrider name having become synonymous with quality arms of all shapes and types. Having inherited a small gun shop from his own father, the arms dealer grew his empire from there. Over the years, Ha’danas invented hundreds of deadly weapons, each one surpassing the last in durability and lethality. This earned him both the respect of civilian and soldier alike, and the recognition of larger governments. While his fortune was massive, he knew he could not control the business forever. He needed an heir. --- Heanor Rosestrider was brought up under the tutorage of his father as the future heir of the business.
