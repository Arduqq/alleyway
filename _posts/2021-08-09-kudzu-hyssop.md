Hyssop's inspiration came from the plant, a flower beloved by bees. Although I debated several glade pets, I opted to go less-traditional with a Chibi #84 and a love of honeybees. Hyssop is essentially a living hive, a creature who has formed a symbiotic relationship with the bees built off the understanding that each creature's existence is fragile in a world ever-changing by human hands.
