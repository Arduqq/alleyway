A kelpie inhabiting a pond in France. She's a shape-shifting water spirit, a black horse-like creature who can take a human form, though she can't stray far from the pond... Daphne's story really opens up intrigue into the history of other characters and acts as a gateway into my story 'Saturn Peaches'. It's all in the early stages of development but through Daphne and the other pets/characters, I've been able to embrace writing and break out of a painfully long creative block! Inspired by summers in the South of France and down-the-rabbit-hole stories like Spirited Away and Alice in Wonderland, this story is an ode to my childhood and a love of children's fantasy stories.
