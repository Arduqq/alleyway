A tribute pet to the ship Rocinante from The Expanse book/tv series. I absolutely adore this incredibly well-written sci-fi series and I wanted to challenge myself with this pet - to do an "inanimate object". As the Roci is the ship itself, I originally had it set as "genderless". I didn't know that Subeta also had a gender glitch which occurred sometimes from adopting Zentus at their source, so when a friend was offering up one for adoption which had no gender marker whatsoever I thought it was perfect for the Roci! I hope those familiar with the series can appreciate the TC and it's allusions to the protomolecule.
