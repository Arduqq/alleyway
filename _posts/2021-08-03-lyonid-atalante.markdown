In a realm that would harbour the entirety of emotions, Herbstvald is the most inviting of the VÃ¤lder. Aside from the warm breeze, the sweet scent and the beautiful, fluid-like clouds that would roam the sky every now and then, Atalante, the guardian of the thicket will wander the lands. Herbstvald manifests any sensation of eagerness in a nest that would slowly treasure an egg of euphoria. Where Atalante would take these eggs is unknown, yet their hatchlings are said to be of divine nature.
